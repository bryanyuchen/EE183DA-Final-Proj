3d Simulation Kalman Filter Variance Sweeping:
contains code to plot error variance with Levenberg-Marquardt + Kalman Filter and without
You can set which error values to sweet
	var comparison sweeps the error linearly
	var comparison log sweeps exponentially

3D Simulation with acc Kalmf:
contains code to for 3D Simulation animation
This one utilizes a kalman filter with an acceleration input
	use test comparisons to run
	

3D Simulation with const Kalmf:
contains code to for 3D Simulation animation
This one utilizes a kalman filter with no state-space input (identity matrix)
	test comparisons to run
