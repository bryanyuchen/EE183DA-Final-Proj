reflects a non-moving sound source around (0.15)
Scatter:
contains code to scatter plot state estimations
useful for comparing error variances
	use LMKF or IEKF scatter to plot

Error Landscape:
Plots error landscapeof test data
	use plotnonlinearls to plot 

Animations:
contains 2D Kalman Filter animations for IEKF AND LM+KF
	use test comparisons to run
	LPF = low pass filter - uses blurring mask to average and limit variance
